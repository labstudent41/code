                              KMonad: Guided tour

  Welcome to the KMonad configuration tutorial. This document aims to explain:
  1. The configuration syntax
  2. The required information
  3. All possible configuration options

  This document should be a runnable configuration, so with some tweaks to the
  `defcfg` block (see below) you should be able to try out all the examples
  interactively.
