# Installing Node Red

(1) Update the system by running the following command in terminal :-
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade


(2) Go to nodered.org and find installation instruction for Rasberry Pi
You will find a bash command which looks like :-

bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/node-red/linux-installers/master/deb/update-nodejs-and-nodered)

Copy and paste that in terminal.


(3) Once the installation is finished, it will ask you some simple questions, use your ðŸ§  and answer them.
Most of them can be left to default settings i.e. just press <Enter>
Say 'no' to anything related to security or else it might try set a password or something which you don't want to deal with.
