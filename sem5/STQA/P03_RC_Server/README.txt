Commands used are :-

javac -cp '.:selenium-java/*' SeleniumDemo.java
java -cp '.:selenium-java/*' SeleniumDemo

OR

javac -cp '.:selenium-server.jar' SeleniumDemo.java
java -cp '.:selenium-server.jar' SeleniumDemo

Downloading the selenium-jar or the selenium-java zip file which contains a lot
of those jars seperately; both worked for me.

Above selenium files can be downloaded from:
    github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/releases

Geckodriver can be downloaded from:
    https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases
