A web object can refer to different things depending on the context. In general, a web object is an element
or component of a web page that performs a specific function or displays specific content.
This can include multimedia content like audio and video, interactive elements like forms and buttons, and even entire web pages embedded within another page.
Some common examples of web objects include images, videos, audio files, and plug-ins like Flash or Java applets.
